# Entanglement-Dynamics
Random unitary time evolution plus projective measurement in the one-dimensional quantum circuit model.

By partitioning the system into three parts, it is possible to calculate the mutual information 
and negativity, which provides more insight into the possible area-to-volume law entanglement phase transitions.

The protocol used in the time evolution is the same as the following papers
